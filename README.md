# chatgpt-plugins
Repository of (most, [if not all?]) ChatGPT manifest files of plugins.

Took me forever to find a consolidated list, and **copilot-us** has the best one I've seen so far (thank you!), but I wanted to break up the massive singular JSON blob into individual mainfest files, so that tools like LibreChat can recognize them easily.

<!-- INSERT TABLE @HERE-->


**If Using LibreChat**
Drop manifests in `/app/api/app/clients/tools/.well-known`

Enjoy!
