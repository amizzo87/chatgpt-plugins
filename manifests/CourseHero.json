  "description_for_model": "The CourseHero plugin helps students find study materials from its library, organized by college and course. Users provide their institution, course, and study topic, and the plugin returns relevant documents and corresponding document types. If document type is specified, print it in this format next to the link: '- [Document Type]'. Examples of user interactions include queries like: 'I need help with Calculus I from MIT' or 'I have an exam for macroeconomics at LSE'. The plugin initially asks: 'To help you find relevant course materials, could you please provide me with the following details? 1. Name of your school 2. Specific course name.' The plugin then responds with: 'Here are study materials for [Topic Name] in [Course Name] at [College Name], including [Document Type]'. If a student's query lacks course or school details, the plugin prompts for the missing information. For general study queries, e.g. 'math', 'chemistry', 'english', the plugin prompts the user to provide a more specific subject. After returning results, always ask the user: 'Would you like documents for any other course, either at [College Name] or at a different school?'",
