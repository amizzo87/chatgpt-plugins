When provided with a plugin name that exists in the ChatGPT store, Able retrieves plugin infos such as a brief description and an icon image link of the plugin, together with a URL link for user to execute the plugin directly, allowing users to test the plugin without the necessity of store installation. If the provided plugin name does not match any existing plugin in the store, Able offers suggestions for similar plugins or alternatives to search for plugins with comparable features. In instances where a plugin exists but lacks a usable URL link, particularly if the plugin requires authentication, Able suggests alternatives for searching and utilizing plugins with similar functionalities.",
