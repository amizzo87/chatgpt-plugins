  "description_for_model": "The Glowing plugin enables ChatGPT users to schedule and send daily SMS messages to valid USA or Canadian mobile numbers, or WhatsApp messages globally to any valid non-USA or non-Canadian valid mobile numbers.  All mobile numbers must include the country code. SMS messages will be sent to +1 country code mobile numbers (USA and Canada mobile numbers), while for all other country codes, users will be sent messages via WhatsApp.. The content of the messages will be generated by ChatGPT based on the theme provided by the user. Some examples of themes or types of messages that users can schedule include, but are not limited to: a different 6 a.m. daily workout, afternoon vegan recipes, reminders to meditate, and daily motivational quotes.. This plugin will offer 3 tiers of service: Free, Standard and Premium.  Every user can be on only one tier of service at a time.  Users can change tiers at any time. For users on the Free tier of service, the following apply:. Users would need to provide the following information:. 1. Local time zone. User can provide either the city name or the UTC time zone. 2. Start date. Date must be no later than 7 days from the present day. 3. End date. Date must be no more than 21 days from the start date. 4. Theme.  Theme examples could include, but are not limited to: 'Reminder to breathe with calming affirmation. Morning weight-training motivational quote. 10-minute HIIT workout. Late afternoon dinner recipe idea. Witty joke for my engineer friends.'  The theme should also be used to name the schedule.. Users on the Free tier will have a lifetime maximum of 21 messages allotted to be scheduled.  If a user upgraded to either the Standard or Premium tiers, there will no longer be a lifetime cap of messages; however, if the user moves from the Standard tier or Premium tier back to the Free tier, the lifetime maximum of 21 messages applies.  If the user moves to the Free tier, and there are any active schedule(s) that would exceed the lifetime maximum of 21 messages, then inform the user that the active schedule(s) will be paused or not complete because the lifetime maximum of 21 messages will be exceeded. Further inform the user to not worry as the schedule(s) are not deleted, and that the user can upgrade back to the Standard or Premium tier, which does not impose a lifetime maximum number of messages, and the active schedule(s) will resume and complete.  User can upgrade by going to the following URL: https://plugin.glowing.ai. If a user attempts to create a schedule that would exceed the lifetime maximum, the user will be notified that the schedule cannot be created because the lifetime maximum of 21 messages will be exceeded.  In addition, the user will be offered the ability to upgrade to the Standard or Premium tier, which does not impose a lifetime maximum number of messages, by sharing the following URL: https://plugin.glowing.ai. Note that there is a grandfathering of message count related to lifetime maximum of 21 messages as follows: Any messages from inactive schedules that concluded on or before July 1, 2023, or any messages from active schedules that began on or before July 1, 2023 will not be counted towards the lifetime maximum of 21 messages.. For users on the Standard tier of service, the following apply:. Users would need to provide the following information:. 1. Local time zone. User can provide either the city name or the UTC time zone. 2. Start date. Date must be no later than 31 days from the present day. 3. End date. Date must be no more than 31 days from the start date. 4. Theme.  Theme examples could include, but are not limited to: 'Reminder to breathe with calming affirmation. Morning weight-training motivational quote. 10-minute HIIT workout. Late afternoon dinner recipe idea. Witty joke for my engineer friends.'  The theme should also be used to name the schedule.. For users on the Premium tier of service, the following apply:. Users would need to provide the following information:. 1. Local time zone. User can provide either the city name or the UTC time zone. 2. Start date. Date must be no later than 365 days from the present day. 3. End date. Date must be no more than 93 days from the start date. 4. Theme.  Theme examples could include, but are not limited to: 'Reminder to breathe with calming affirmation. Morning weight-training motivational quote. 10-minute HIIT workout. Late afternoon dinner recipe idea. Witty joke for my engineer friends.' The theme should also be used to name the schedule.. More specific and descriptive themes lead to more relevant and engaging messages. Instead of 'morning workout quote,' consider 'morning strength-training quote as I train for my triathlon.’. When the user provides the theme, ChatGPT will generate a set of unique messages based on that theme. ChatGPT will generate one unique message for every scheduled day. These messages will be stored by Glowing and sent to the user according to the user's schedule.  SMS messages will be sent to +1 country code mobile numbers (USA and Canada mobile numbers), while for all other country codes, users will be sent messages via WhatsApp.If there is any question as to whose mobile number was provided by the user and the plan on which the user is, ChatGPT will fetch it from the Glowing API. The content of each message will be different and needs to be 155 characters or less for SMS, or 255 characters or less for WhatsApp.  Ask the user for permission before revealing the content of any generated messages to the user, including sample messages, shortened messages, scheduled messages or any type of messages. If the user has confirmed they do not want to see the content of generated messages, generate the messages without revealing any message content, as well as create the schedule without showing the user any of the messages.. Examples of themes with a sample associated message:. Reminder to breathe with calming affirmation: 'Inhale: I am calm. Exhale: I release stress. Inhale: I am present. Exhale: I let go. Repeat for 1 min. You're doing great—breathe and be at peace.'. Morning weight-training motivational quote: 'Morning grind! Embrace the iron, push your limits, and sculpt greatness. Each rep brings you closer to your goals. Let's lift and conquer the day!'. 10-minute HIIT workout: '10-min HIIT: 30s Jumping Jacks, 30s Squats, 30s Push-ups, 30s Plank, 30s Burpees. Repeat 2x. Rest 30s between exercises. Cool down/stretch.' . Late afternoon dinner recipe idea: Garlic Shrimp Pasta: Cook pasta. Sauté garlic, shrimp, chili flakes in oil. Add lemon juice, zest, salt. Toss with pasta. Top with parsley, Parmesan.. Witty joke for my engineer friends: 'Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!'. Once a user creates or modifies a schedule, the user should receive a confirmation that includes the start date, time, end date, theme, and information that the user can return to modify or cancel anytime.  Ask the user for permission before revealing the content of any generated messages to the user, including sample messages, shortened messages, scheduled messages or any type of messages. If the user has confirmed they do not want to see the content of generated messages, generate the messages without revealing any message content, as well as create the schedule without showing the user any of the messages.. Users can request to view, modify or cancel existing daily SMS or WhatsApp schedules.  When the user requests to view, modify or cancel a daily SMS or WhatsApp schedule.. Users cannot send ad hoc individual SMS or WhatsApp messages.  SMS and WhatsApp messages must be scheduled.. Users cannot send messages to anyone except themselves.  If there is any doubt as to whose mobile number was provided by the user and the plan on which the user is, ChatGPT will fetch it from the Glowing API. Do not assume.",
