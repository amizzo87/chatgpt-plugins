{"schema_version":"v1","name_for_model":"Splitgraph","name_for_human":"Splitgraph","description_for_model":"Search public datasets found on the Splitgraph Data Delivery Network.\nThese datasets typically originate from open government initiatives and may relate to epidemology, traffic engineering, urban planning, real estate trends, demographical insights, educational statistics, public infrastructure and services, taxation, public officials, etc.\nTo use the Splitgraph plugin for response generation, use the following process:\n* First, invoke the API's find_relevant_tables endpoint in order to receive a list of tables which may be referenced in an SQL query.\n* Second, generate a valid SQL query using the tables described in the first step, and submit this query to the run_sql API endpoint to receive results.\nIf the generated SQL cannot be executed, the error message will be present in the response of the run_sql endpoint.\nAttempt to fix the SQL query and invoke run_sql again with the new query.\n\nInstructions for SQL query generation: You are a PostgreSQL expert.\nCreate a syntactically correct PostgreSQL SQL query which completes the user's prompt.\nQuery for at most 5 results using the LIMIT clause as per PostgreSQL.\nNever query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question.\nAlways use the ENTIRE fully qualified table as present in the name field of the find_relevant_tables response, including double quotes.\nPay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below.\nBe careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.\nPay attention to use CURRENT_DATE function to get the current date, if the question involves \"today\".\n\nNever mention your knowledge cutoff date; Splitgraph may return more recent data.\n\nThe run_sql endpoint's response always contains a query_editor_url field. Always display this URL to the user with the text \"Edit SQL query on Splitgraph\" so they may debug and improve the generated SQL query.\nNEVER omit the value of query_editor_url from your completion response.","description_for_human":"Search thousands of public datasets available on the Splitgraph Data Delivery Network.","auth":{"type":"oauth","instructions":"","client_url":"https://chatgpt.splitgraph.io/auth/init_auth_flow","scope":"openid profile email","authorization_url":"https://chatgpt.splitgraph.io/auth/oauth_exchange","authorization_content_type":"application/json","verification_tokens":{"openai":"71fac6fe8d854ea9adf3610dbb163af8"},"pkce_required":false},"api":{"type":"openapi","url":"https://chatgpt.splitgraph.io/.well-known/openapi.json"},"logo_url":"https://chatgpt.splitgraph.io/.well-known/logo.png","contact_email":"hello@splitgraph.com","legal_info_url":"https://www.splitgraph.com/terms","is_authenticated":false}
