{"schema_version":"v1","name_for_model":"SkyPoint_AI","name_for_human":"SkyPoint AI","description_for_model":"This plugin facilitates dialogue between a user and ChatGPT, designed to interact with SkyPoint Lakehouse business data. It generates precise, contextually relevant, and personalized responses based on user queries. Instance Selection: Upon asking a question, users are presented with a list of instances in a table-like format. Each instance contains 'Row Number,' 'Tenant Name,' 'Instance ID,' and 'Instance Name.' Selecting an instance is mandatory before the question is sent to the PostPrompt function. By default, a cached version of the instances is used if available. If 'cachedVersion' is false, the latest instances are fetched. If only one instance is available, it's automatically selected as the default, and the user's question is directly sent to the PostPrompt function. Sending Prompts: Once an instance is selected, all consecutive questions are processed by it. If the instance name is unique, users can select by Instance Name. If there are multiple instances with the same name, users should select by Instance ID. It's crucial to preserve the user's original query for accurate and relevant information. Switching Instances: Users can switch instances by specifying the instance name or requesting all eligible instances. If the specified instance doesn't match the allowed instances, an invalid message is displayed, and the eligible instances are presented again. After switching instances, the user is prompted to ask a new question. If only one instance is available, the user is informed that there are no other instances to switch to. Printing Output: All responses specify the Instance Name in the footer of the answer, separate from the main answer. This is mandatory and should not be overlooked. When there is only one instance available and it is automatically selected, the Instance Name is not specified in the response, as it's understood to be the default. This plugin maintains transparency and clarity for the user, providing accurate and contextually relevant information based on their selected instance.","description_for_human":"Chat with your unified business data to answer questions, automate tasks, and boost your productivity.","auth":{"type":"oauth","instructions":"","client_url":"https://sicdpstage.b2clogin.com/sicdpstage.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1a_accountlink_signup_signin/oauth2/v2.0/authorize","scope":"openid profile offline_access https://sicdpstage.onmicrosoft.com/api/read_write https://sicdpstage.onmicrosoft.com/api/user_impersonation ","authorization_url":"https://sicdpstage.b2clogin.com/sicdpstage.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1a_accountlink_signup_signin/oauth2/v2.0/token","authorization_content_type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded","verification_tokens":{"openai":"0d08976a19704c5fba62b9ac19d695a7"}},"api":{"type":"openapi","url":"https://plugin.skypointcloud.com/swagger/v1/swagger.json"},"logo_url":"https://skypointcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SkyPoint_Black_Logo.png","contact_email":"support@skypointcloud.com","legal_info_url":"https://skypointcloud.com/terms/"}
