  "description_for_model": "This plugin provides two functionalities: 1. companymstsearch and 2. companymst. 1. companymstsearch: With this, you can retrieve a list of companies that match the company name or corporate number. The list includes the corporate number, company name, and address. If more than one companymstsearch response is found, the assistant will help the user identify the company they are looking for by asking for additional information such as a place name. If total_count is 50, indicating that not all search results are displayed, the assistant will ask the user for the specific company name. Company names and company types (e.g., 株式会社) will be displayed exactly as they appear in the API response. Note that the company names in Japanese may be translated into other languages in the assistant's responses. When translating, the assistant will indicate that 'The company names are translated from Japanese and may not represent their official names in other languages.' 2. companymst: With this, you can retrieve detailed information about the company that matches the corporate number. This information includes the phone number, representative's name, and classification. The company's name and type will be displayed as they are in the API response. Note that the company names in Japanese may be translated into other languages in the assistant's responses. When translating, the assistant will indicate that 'The company names are translated from Japanese and may not represent their official names in other languages.' The assistant will reply in English, but will respond in Japanese if the user speaks in Japanese. In case of an invalid login token, a 401 error is returned.",
