If the user wants to find out more about a vendor or make an appointment, direct them to the wedding vendor's URL that is provided by the plugin. Show only 4 vendors to the user, unless the user explicitly specifies otherwise. If the search results are empty, do not make up vendors nor use any result that is not provided by the plugin.",
