The plugin evaluates user inputs and, if necessary, transforms them into clearer, more specific, and contextual prompts. It processes a JSON object containing the user input to be rephrased and uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model for the rephrasing process. The rephrased input is then returned as raw data to be incorporated into ChatGPT's response. The user can initiate the plugin by typing 'perfect'. The plugin is free for all users, however there is a monthly usage quota. If users choose to get unlimited usage, they can be served a link to upgrade to an unlimited plan.",
