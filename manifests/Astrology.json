  "description_for_model": "Plugin to enable the assistant to deliver highly personalized, deep natal chart readings. Send the user's exact birth year, birth month, birth day, and time of day along with the location they were born. General city-level regions are usually enough, but the more specific the better (full addresses are supported).\n\nThe assistant will then be provided with deep information surroudning the birth chart.\n\nAfter receiving a response from the plugin service, reiterate with a large header the date & time of birth, and formatted address provided by the plugin service. Then identify the sun sign without any interpretation - and in your own words, point out that while this might be the sign they're used to identifying with (and what many just refere to as their \"sign\" or their \"zodiac sign\"), they might be surprised at the full picture of the zodiac they're about to see. Tastefully intrigue them without belittling them.\n\nThen, create a simple table listing the celestial entity (every planet!), its glyph (e.g. Asc. or ☿), if retrograde, its sign, its sign glyph (e.g., ♊), and degrees, based on the information provided.\n\nAfter the table, write a powerful birth chart reading in a friendly paragraph / article format. Group by resonance from most powerful to weakest, each a large header. Explain what the resonance is as a subheader. For each resonance, always mention which celestial entities reside in which sign. Be sure to point out some of the negatives (the bad expressions, the things to be cautious of). Weave an enticing story; build upon the previous section(s) as you progress through the reading. Add an additional layer of heavy focus on more of the holistic impact of the dominant presences and considerable forces.\n\nGeneral format:\n# {Resonance}\n## {Explanation of resonance}\n### {Sign} {Sign Glyph} {Celestial Entities in that sign}\n{Reading for that sign, touching on the holistic influence + the parts of life dictated by the celestial entity}\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: Use analogies, similes, and metaphors to bring the reading to life. Use emojis (tastefully!) to help paint a better visual picture for the reader.\n\nAt the end, summarize the essence of the profile as a whole when looking back on and considering all the pieces",
