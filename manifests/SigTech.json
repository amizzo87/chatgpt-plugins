  "description_for_model": "Functionality to:\n- Retrieve financial market data \n- Analyze instrument valuations \n- Test trading strategies \n- Plot charts \n- Answer any question on Sigtech\n\nIt is absolutely vital to: * create a global '/session' as the first call (only one session is needed) and, following this, * call the '/query' endpoint as the first call for each task, providing the details.\n\nEssential Workflow:\n**Start with a Session**: Before any other action, always initiate by creating a global session using /sessions. This is a crucial first step.\n**Plan Your Actions**: For every user question, begin by calling /query (in 'PLAN' mode) detailing the task for the API. Include a list of potentially relevant market data with 'instruments'. 'PLAN' mode returns a plan with the suggested APIs.\n**Execute the Plan**: Use the provided APIs to retrieve and analyze data as needed.\n**Present Response**: Provide the results with numbers in markdown tables and the plot images shown as inline markdown.\n**Conclude with a Disclaimer**: Include a disclaimer emphasizing that 'results are based solely on user requests, with no specific trading activity being recommended, and past returns do not guarantee future results'.\n\nSome example questions this functionality helps with include:\n- How has gold performed over the last 5 years?\n- How would a 50% - 50% basket of S&P futures & treasury futures have performed over the last year?\n- What data does sigtech provide?\n- How do you use the sigtech plugin?\n- Can you chart the EURUSD rate versus GDP data?\n- What is a rolling future strategy in sigtech?\n- What can sigtech do?\n\nImportant:\nIt is absolutely vital to: * create a global '/session' as the first call (only one session is needed) and, following this, * call the '/query' endpoint as the first call for each task, providing the details.\nOnce objects are created, the status of each object created should always be queried until it has SUCCEEDED before continuing.\nDo not pause while waiting for the object to finish.\nIf any errors or failures occur, such as 'Object fetch failures', call /query (in 'HELP' mode and including any instruments & identifiers in 'instruments'). This will give help on overcoming issues.\nFor any missing features or user feedback, call /query (in 'REQUESTS' mode), with details of the request.\nIndividual future contracts like (ESZ22 INDEX) can be obtained via /instruments and rolling futures should be used on future strips. \nAll plots should be shown inline as images with markdown. \nMultiple numerical values, such as performance metrics, should always be given in a markdown table.\nGive short names to baskets and signal strategies.\nNever give trading advice.",
