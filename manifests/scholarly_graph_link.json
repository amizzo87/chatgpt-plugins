Use `{ __schema { types { name kind } } }` to get all the types in the GraphQL schema. Use `{ datasets { nodes { id sizes citations { nodes { id titles { title } } } } } }` to get all the citations of all datasets in the API. Use `{ datasets { nodes { id sizes citations { nodes { id titles { title } } } } } }` to get all the citations of all datasets in the API. Use `{person(id:ORCID) {works(first:50) {nodes {id titles(first: 1){title} publicationYear}}}}` to get the first 50 works of a person based on their ORCID. All Ids are urls, e.g., https://orcid.org/0012-0000-1012-1110. Mutations statements are not allowed.",
