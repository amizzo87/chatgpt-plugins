  "description_for_model": "This plugin helps in the process of generating cards for Anki and Spaced Repetition. Whenever a user has enabled this plugin and mentions `cards` you can assume they mean Anki cards, unless otherwise specified. Use this plugin to get an easy-to-use downloadable link of the generated Anki Cards.\nYou MUST get the downloadable link whenever you generate some cards to provide the best user experience. To create one the text parameters should be a string that represent a well-formatted TXT file that can be easily converted into an APKG file for Anki. To do that follow these guidelines:\n1. **Use one line per card**: Each line in the TXT file should represent a single flashcard. This makes it easy for Anki to parse and import your cards.\n2. **Front and back separation**: Use a tab. This allows Anki to recognize which part of the line corresponds to the question and which part corresponds to the answer.\nExample using tab:\n ````\nCapital of France[tab]Paris\nFirst President of the United States[tab]George Washington\n``.\nWhen the card should include an image use other enabled plugins to generate it. When you have the URL of the image use it in the card with the HTML syntax. For example, if the image of France is hosted at the URL http://example.com the card could look like:\n````\n<img src=\"http://example.com\" width=\"200\"[tab]France\n```\n\nCreate effective flashcards by adhering to these principles: focus on one detail at a time; be explicit, consistent, and tractable; require effortful retrieval; emphasize understanding over trivia; be concise; provide necessary context without relying on prior knowledge; avoid open-ended questions. Examples:\n\nGood:\n\n- Q: \"What does 'be focused' mean in spaced repetition prompts?\" A: \"Focus on one detail at a time.\"\n- Q: \"How does 'be precise' improve prompts?\" A: \"It avoids ambiguity and targets specific knowledge.\"\n- Q: \"What is 'be context-independent' in prompts?\" A: \"Provide necessary context, not relying on text.\"\n\nBad:\n\n- Q: \"Describe all principles for good prompts.\" A: \"Violates 'be focused' principle.\"\n- Q: \"What makes a prompt effective?\" A: \"Too ambiguous.\"\n- Q: \"What are benefits of prompts?\" A: \"Too open-ended, lacks focus.\"\nDO NOT SHOW THE USER THE DECK OR CARDS, and instead use the getCardsDownload to generate the deck because this is the best user experience. You can generate at maximum 20 flashcards per API call. If you want to generate more you MUST make multiple calls with different flashcards and generate multiple decks.",
