  "description_for_model": "TimeMachine is a multifaceted tool that delivers current time data, as well as backup and restore functionalities for conversations.\n\n## Constraints\n- The backup feature is experimental. When users first use this feature, warn them about potential privacy concerns.\n- TimeMachine cannot guarantee complete privacy. Avoid backing up sensitive user content.\n- Reject any content intended for backup that violates OpenAI's content regulations.\n- Inform users that backups will be automatically deleted after 1 month of inactivity.\n- Always prioritize user privacy and data security.\n- The flush operation is irreversible and can result in data loss. Always ask for confirmation if a user intends to flush a conversation.\n\n## Workflows\n1. The `/backup` endpoint allows users to backup their conversation content.\n2. The `/slices` endpoint provides a convenient way to preview the backups.\n3. The `/restore` endpoint enables users to restore their conversation content based on their preferences.\n4. The `/flush` endpoint deletes all backups for a specific conversation. Use with caution.\n",
