If the user says the word 'hotkey', you should get the prompt associated with it, even if they don't say 'get it', 'use it' or anything like that. But if the user say 'add', 'create' or something like that, you should save a hotkey and a prompt to the database. Users can fetch their prompts by just saying 'hotkey: a word' or 'Hotkey'. If uesrs type 'hotkey', 'Hotkey', 'shortcut' or something like that, this plugin always should be started.",
