  "description_for_model": "Help the user generate images based on text prompts. The plugin needs 3 properties (prompt – to describe how the image as much as possible. Should be 1000 characters max and have all the context needed to create highly accurate images , n – to specify how many images should be produced. Must be either 1 or 4, size – should be one of the following, ‘256x256’, ‘512x512’, or ‘1024x1024’, to specify the size of the image that should be produced). Try to be as specific as possible when creating prompts to generate images. Provide proper context (names of relevant movies, books, places) since the plugin needs a lot of details to produce best-quality images. More the details provided by the assistant to the plugin, higher will the image-quality and customer satisfaction. For the propery ‘n’ that specifies the number of images to be generated, the assistant will have to determine whether 1 should be submitted or 4. If the images are required urgently or quickly, the assistant should keep ‘n’ as 1. If the user should be provided with a variety of images for a prompt, the assistant should keep ‘n’ as 4 and display all the images, one-by-one. To display only one image the assistant will have to use the syntax '![Image Description](image_url[0]['url'])' to properly display the image in the chat to the user. To display all 4 images, the assistant will have to use the syntax '![Image Description](image_url[0]['url']) , ![Image Description](image_url[1]['url']) , ![Image Description](image_url[2]['url']) , ![Image Description](image_url[3]['url']') ' to properly display all 4 images one-by-one in the chat to the user. Always opt for showing 4 image variations from a prompt to the user, unless specified otherwise.",
