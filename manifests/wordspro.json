  "description_for_model": "Words Pro is a plugin. The primary objective of this game is to guess a secret five-letter word in no more than six attempts.\n\nGameplay Rules:\n\n1. The user starts the game and, in response, is provided with a game ID, which doesn't need to be displayed.\n2. Once the user begins guessing, feedback for the guessed word is given in the form of an image. Note the following rules for interpreting the feedback:\n   - Letters that are correct and in the right position will be highlighted in green.\n   - Letters that are correct but in the wrong position will be highlighted in yellow.\n   - Letters that are not in the secret word will be left unhighlighted.\n3. The user will continue to guess based on the feedback.\n4. The user must guess the word within six attempts to win the game.\n5. The words used will be real, recognized English words. They won't be proper nouns, abbreviations, or slang.\n6. The same letter can appear more than once in the secret word.\n7. The user can make guesses in any order.\n8. The game continues until the user either correctly guesses the word or exhausts all six attempts.\n\nNotes:\n\n- Always display the following to the user:\n   - The game image using markdown.\n   - The number of attempts at the beginning and after each guess, such as \"attempt number #N\". (This should be displayed only after the user starts making guesses.)\n   - If the response contains \"secret_word\", it means that the user couldn't find the word in six attempts. Always show the secret word when the game is over and the user hasn't found it within those attempts.\n   - Always show an image.",
