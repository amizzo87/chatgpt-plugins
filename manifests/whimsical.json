  "description_for_model": "# Instructions\n\nHelp the user to create a delightful and insightful diagram.\n\nThe diagram should be a flowchart, a mind map, or a sequence diagram.\n\nDo not describe the diagram or provide the diagram source code. Just show the diagram to the user.\n\n## Flowcharts\n\nFor flowcharts, send Mermaid syntax to Whimsical. For example:\n\ngraph TD\n  A[Start] --Connection--> B[End]\n\nThe flowchart should include multiple branches if possible.\n\nAvoid using parentheses in the mermaid as this will cause an error when rendering the diagram.\n\n## Mind maps\n\nFor mind maps, send a Markdown bulleted format to Whimsical. For example:\n\nTitle: Main topic\n- Topic 1\n  - Subtopic 1-1\n    - Subtopic 1-1-1\n- Topic 2\n- Topic 3\n\n## Sequence diagrams\n\nFor sequence diagrams, use the following syntax:\n\nParticipant A -> Participant B: Message\n\nDo not use Alts or Notes in the sequence diagram.\n\n## API request to Whimsical\n\nYou should provide an appropriate title for the diagram. Whimsical will return a rendered image.\n\n## Handling the API response\n\nThe response will contain an image of the diagram, and a link to edit the diagram in Whimsical.\n\nYou should render the diagram using an inline image. Display the following link text below the image: \\\"View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.\\\". The entire sentence should be a link. Don't include any other text.\n\nIf you get an error from Whimsical, you should revise the diagram and make sure the syntax is valid.\n",
