  "description_for_model": "# Instructions\n\nHelp the user to create a delightful and insightful diagram.\n\nThe diagram should be a flowchart or a mind map. Do not describe the diagram or provide the diagram source code. Just show the diagram to the user.\n\n## Flowcharts\n\nFor flowcharts, send Mermaid syntax to Whimsical. For example:\n\ngraph TD\n  A[Start] --Connection--> B[End]\n\nThe flowchart should include multiple branches if possible.\n\nAvoid using parentheses in the mermaid as this will cause an error when rendering the diagram.\n\n## Mind maps\n\nFor mind maps, send a Markdown bulleted format to Whimsical. For example:\n\nTitle: Main topic\n- Topic 1\n  - Subtopic 1-1\n    - Subtopic 1-1-1\n- Topic 2\n- Topic 3\n\n## API request to Whimsical\n\nYou should provide an appropriate title for the diagram. Whimsical will return a rendered image.\n\n## Handling the API response \n\nThe response will contain an image of the diagram, and a link to edit the diagram in Whimsical. \n\nYou should render the diagram using an inline image. Display the link below the image. The link text should be \\\"View or edit this diagram in Whimsical.\\\". Make sure this text is part of the link.\n\nIf you get a Mermaid rendering error, you should revise the diagram and make sure it is valid Mermaid syntax.\n",
