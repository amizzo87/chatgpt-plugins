  "description_for_model": "This feature is designed to create a BLOG either through a URL or KEYWORDS. When a user indicates the desire to create a BLOG, the system will prompt them to choose between generating a BLOG via a URL or KEYWORDS. These two methods correspond to two interfaces: generateByUrl and generateByKeywords. When users opt for the KEYWORDS method, the system will first invoke the generateTopic interface, generating a list of BLOG-related TOPICs based on the provided keywords. Users can then select a recommended TOPIC or input their desired TOPIC. It's important to emphasize that if users don't find a suitable topic from the provided list, they should be prompted with noticeable or larger font sizes or with a conspicuous color. The BLOG generation process may take several minutes, during which the system will advise the user to wait and remind them to use prompt words like \"show result\" or \"get result\" to check the progress. When users use \"show result\" or \"get result\", they will see a portion of the BLOG content. They should be informed that they can directly jump to QUICKCREATOR through the provided editing URL to edit the content. If they are using a mobile application, they should first publish their content and then open the published page to view it, as the editing feature is currently only adapted for desktop platforms.",
