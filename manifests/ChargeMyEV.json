  "description_for_model": "OVERVIEW: 'Charge My EV' offers a service for locating public EV charging stations across the US, including both universal and Tesla-exclusive supercharger stations globally. SEARCH: Users can find charging stations by title, provider/vendor, city, state/province, or country. Each charging station's properties, such as title, address, number of chargers, provider, connector type, and other relevant details, can be found within the 'items' array of the location responses. Each location item also has a unique permalink to the Charge My EV guide for more information. ENDPOINTS: Majority of searches utilize the 'chargers/all-available' endpoint. For specific inquiries like, 'where can I supercharge my non-Tesla in the UK?' or 'Where can I supercharge my BMW in Germany?', query parameters 'nonTeslaSuperchargerEnabled' as 'true' and provider as 'Tesla' should be passed. For general inquiries like 'where can I charge in Reno?', pass the 'city' query parameter set to 'Reno'. For statistics, use 'superchargers/total-stats-tesla-locations'. To find upcoming supercharger locations, use 'superchargers/tesla-planned'. For FAQs related to the API, use 'superchargers/frequently-asked-questions'. RESPONSE OBJECT: The root response object contains the 'totalAvailableCount' property, which is the total number of locations found. It also includes a 'meta' object with additional information about the request-response, for example if there was an error. Actual locations are found within the 'items' array property located at the root-level. Each location item within the 'items' array has properties such as: title, address, permalink, map_url, provider, connector_types, isTeslaSupercharger, isTeslaSuperchargerForNonTeslas, isTeslaDestinationCharger, etc. all to help identify the location and its properties. DISPLAYING LOCATION DETAILS: Unless specified, results are prefixed with the total locations using the 'totalAvailableCount' property, followed by the location details in a markdown list format. Location details should include Station Title, Provider/Vendor, Connector Types, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Number of Chargers, Charging Speed, Access Information, and the corresponding Charge My EV guide Permalink in the format of 'https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/{location_id}' or map URL to the location using Google Maps in the format of 'https://www.google.com/maps/place/{latitude},{longitude}' that can be used for the location's 'More Info' link. If location titles are hyperinked, Tesla location would be listed with their titles being a link in the format of https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/{location_id} while non-Tesla charging location titles would be a link in the format of https://www.google.com/maps/place/{latitude},{longitude} followed by the locations' details. No other 3rd-party link should ever be used or linked to other than from the 'map_url' and 'permalink' properties for each location. LIMITS & FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS: Up to 10 results are displayed by default. If more than 10 results exist, inform the user and provide a summary of additional locations by providers, states and or cities which can be found within the 'meta' sub-object from the root response. EXAMPLE 1 (MULTIPLE CITIES, PROVIDERS, ETC.): A user inquiry such as 'Where are Tesla Superchargers and Electrify America stations in Reno, Sparks, Winnemucca, and Elko?' would use a comma-separated list of cities and 'NV' for the state, with providers set as 'Tesla, Electrify America'. All relevant charging locations can be found in the root-level 'items' array. The providers attribute can be used to determine what provider, e.g. Tesla or Electrify America in this example, each location belongs to. For this particular query, the user would be provided something like: There are {X} number of available charging locations throughout Reno, Sparks, Winnemucca, and Elko, Nevada, followed by each locations' details. The {X} value would be from the response's totalCount property. Each Tesla location would be listed with their titles being a link in the format of https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/{location_id} while non-Tesla charging location titles would be a link in the format of https://www.google.com/maps/place/{latitude},{longitude} followed by the locations' details. EXAMPLE 2 (SINGLE CITY): A user inquiry such as 'Where can I charge in Reno?' would use 'Reno' for the city and 'NV' for the state. All relevant charging locations can be found in the root-level 'items' array. Each Tesla location would be listed with their titles being a link in the format of https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/{location_id} while non-Tesla charging location titles would be a link in the format of https://www.google.com/maps/place/{latitude},{longitude} followed by the locations' details. EXAMPLE 3 (SINGLE CITY ORGANIZED BY PROVIDER): A user inquiry such as 'Where can I charge in Los Angeles, California organized by provider?' would use 'Los Angeles' for the city and 'CA' for the state. All relevant charging locations can be found in the root-level 'items' array. Each provider would list its respective charging locations under its provider name. Tesla locations would be listed with their titles being a link in the format of https://charge-my-ev.guide/l/{location_id} while non-Tesla provider charging location titles, for example from ChargePoint or Electrify America, would be a link in the format of https://www.google.com/maps/place/{latitude},{longitude} followed by the locations' details.
