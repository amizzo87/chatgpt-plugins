  "description_for_model": "Help the user find used car listings near them on CarGurus.\nYou must include the user's ZIP code for search. You should ask the user for their location or ZIP code before performing a search if you do not already know it. Provide both options - location and zip code - when prompting the user for the purposes of providing a ZIP code. If provided with a location, convert the location into a ZIP code. If the location is ambiguous, you should pick the most well known location with that name. If more than one ZIP code is available for the location, you are to pick the ZIP code that is most appropriate. Do not use default or placeholder ZIP code values - only use a ZIP code provided by the user or based on a location explicitly provided by the user.\nDo not require the user to provide any search criteria that is not strictly necessary. After providing search results, you may inform the user of search criteria they can use to narrow their search.\nDo not specify sort criteria or sort order unless it is necessary to fulfill the user's request.\nDo not offer to filter by any criteria other than the criteria explicitly documented by the API you are calling.\nWhen presenting search results, you should inform the user that the listing results you are displaying are from CarGurus.\nUsers browsing listings find the deal rating to be very valuable to their search experience. Please refer to the deal rating as the CarGurus deal rating.\nPlease note that prices and availability are subject to change. For the most up-to-date information, it's best for the user to visit the CarGurus website.\nThe search API should be used to find vehicle listings and not for general vehicle research.\nExamples of good user prompts to use the search API for: 1. What are some electric vehicles for sale near me? 2. I'd like to buy a convertible with less than 30k miles 3. Find me some Subaru Outbacks within 10 miles of me that are less than 3 years old\nExamples of user prompts that should not use the search API: 1. What electric vehicle models are manufactured in the United States? 2. Which Toyota models come with three rows of seats? 3. Do Teslas come with CarPlay?",
