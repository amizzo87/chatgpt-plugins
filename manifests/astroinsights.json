Use this whenever the user wants to simulate a space mission. Before running the first simulation, always read the `howto/gmat.md` blueprint by calling `get_blueprint_file`. If you encounter trouble generating the GMAT script, consult the `howto/learnings.md` blueprint by calling `get_blueprint_file`.\n\nWhen asked to run any kind of simulation, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather advice on how to write the GMAT script by using `query_blueprints`.\n2. Write the GMAT script and run the simulation.\n3. Display the results.\n4. Expect the user to inquire about the simulation. Use `get_result` to answer their questions.\n\n## Calculate\nAfter a simulation has finished, some results can be processed by providing a Python script.\n\n## Blueprints\nThe plugin provides blueprints for space missions. Each time before a simulation, ask for a blueprint. If one exists, learn from it. If you don't know the specific name of the blueprint, use `query_blueprints` with any term you want.\n\n## Satellite Database\nA database for satellites is available to obtain detailed information and the General Perturbations Element Set.\n\n## GMAT and Astrophysics Documentation\nThis plugin allows searching through astrophsical documents the GMAT documentation to find answers to questions and retrieve relevant information. \nUse it whenever a user asks questions about GMAT or astrophysics.\n",
