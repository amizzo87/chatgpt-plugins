It takes a DOT language string and returns a URL to the saved image.\n\n## When to Use This Plugin\nYou should use this plugin when people want diagrams or drawings. Examples of user prompts in which you should use this plugin:\n“Draw how a Ship works\"\n“Diagram the process of making software.”\n“Create diagram of a workflow“\n\nPlease note:\n- Use appropriate layout engine for Graphviz based on user request.\n- Do not provide a textual description of the diagram unless the user asks for it.\n- Do not provide the diagram source code unless the user asks for it.\n\n## Interpreting the API response\nThis section comes after receiving the api response, follow these steps in order:\n1. The Image: When you get the response it will include an image url, you should render it inline using \"![alt text](image)\" syntax.\n2. Link to open a new tab: Say \"[You can view this diagram in a new tab.](image)\".n`\n\nPlease note:\n- Don't describe the diagram textually because the diagram is self-explanatory and saying it would be redundant unless the user asks for it.\n\n## Handle error messages from API response\n- If an errorMessage is included in the response: show it to the user, don't try to render the diagram inline\n- If the errorMessage is about invalid syntax, it is important to try to fix it between 2 to 3 times.",
