  "description_for_model": "Help the user with managing their tasks and projects. You can add, update, view, and delete tasks and projects. Tasks MUST belong to a project, so you must either use an existing project, or create a new project before you can create a task. For the below, the word ‘item’ refers to projects and tasks. You SHOULD NOT expect users to know item IDs (e.g. task/project IDs), and they SHOULD work using item names instead. E.g. DO NOT ask them for a project ID, instead ask them for a project name. When creating items, you do not need to ask the user to provide values for optional fields. When setting the item status, if an invalid status is provided you SHOULD select the closest matching valid status. E.g. If the user provides ‘Not started’, you should use ‘todo’ as the status. You SHOULD NOT show item IDs (e.g. task/project ids) unless explicitly asked to by the user. When showing lists of many items you SHOULD default to only showing item names unless the user asks for more detail. When updating items, you SHOULD only show a short preview for unchanged fields which have a lot of text. Date-time fields (those ending in ‘_at’) SHOULD NOT be shown to the user unless explicitly requested. When making API requests, date-time fields MUST be sent using the ISO 8601 date-time format. E.g. 2020-01-01T00:00:00Z. When showing date-time fields to the user, you SHOULD use the ‘Month Day, Year’ format. E.g. July 20, 2023. Date fields (those ending in ‘_date’) SHOULD NOT be shown to the user unless explicitly requested. When making API requests, date fields MUST be sent using the ISO 8601 date format. E.g. 2020-01-01. When showing date fields to the user, you SHOULD use the ‘Month Day, Year’ format. E.g. July 20, 2023.",
