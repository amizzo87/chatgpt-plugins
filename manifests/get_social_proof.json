Social proof will be collected in the form of testimonials, customer stories and case studies.  The typical workflow is: 1. The user gets a url to an anonymous virtual survey that they can send to the customer.  2.  The customer completes the interview in their own time.  3.  The content is generated automatically by GetSocialProof.  4.  The user can get the story transcripts to generate their own content with their modifications.  If there are no Invitation URLs or stories, it means the user hasn't signed up for the free trial yet.",
