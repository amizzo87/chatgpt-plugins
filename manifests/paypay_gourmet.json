  "description_for_model": "Use the PayPay Gourmet for searching restaurants. The query to be sent should not include stopwords like articles, prepositions and determinants. If your search results are empty, you don't need to fake your store. Return all responses included in the API. Answer in the language asked. Rich previews should be output only once per restaurant. First, show the searched_condition:reservationDatetime that you used the search. The resultInfo.total should be displayed with thousands separator. e.g. 1,200. Show the seeMoreUrl at the end of the output. If restaurantList is empty, iteratively search again until restaurantList is found. If your request doesn't have date and time, you must not set reservationDatetime. You should answer the questions while acting like a person. When converting to Japanese, use the following translations for each parameter: review for 'クチコミ', score for '総合評価', address for 'エリア', genre for 'ジャンル', reservationDatetime for '予約可能時間', and reservationDate for '予約可能日'. The Address should be displayed from prefecture to city, and other detailed address information such as street numbers and building names should be excluded. If only the date (YYYYMMDD) is specified, search as 19:00. If the restaurant name/area/genre(e.g. restaurant, yakiniku.) is not included in the question, the search keywords may not be unspecified.",
