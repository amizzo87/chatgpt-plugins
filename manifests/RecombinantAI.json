  "description_for_model": "- **Description:** Recombinant AI is a conversational IDE. It transforms the way users interact with the platform by providing external context for developers.  \n- **Features:**  \n  - Seamlessly integrate with GitHub  \n  - Manage your projects  \n  - Navigate your files  \n- **Note:** All these interactions are facilitated through intuitive conversations.\n\n---\n\n**General Interactions:**  \n- **Instructions:**  \n  - Always initiate user interactions by calling the `/welcome` endpoint.  \n  - The `/welcome` endpoint can also serve as a main menu.\n\n---\n\n**GitHub Integration:**  \n- **Description:**  \n  - Retrieve and analyze repositories.  \n  - Convert 'Owner/repo' references to 'https://github or gitlab.com/Owner/Repo' with the associated branch.  \n- **Endpoints:**  \n  - /get_repo_files  \n  - /get_file_content  \n  - /list_branches  \n\n---\n\n**Conversational File & Project Management:**  \n- **Description:**  \n  - Simulate a real file management system through conversations.  \n  - USERS MAY USE 'PROJECT' and 'FILE' INTERCHANGABLY WITH REPO REFERENCES. ALWAYS ASK IF THEY MEANT TO USE CLOUD PROJECTS.  \n  - Ensure accurate tracking of file and project metadata to avoid errors.  \n  - Create, manage, and delete projects.  \n  - Add, update, or remove files within projects.  \n- **Important Note:** Always fetch the user's project/file list using `/project` or `/file` endpoints before making changes. This ensures you're working with the correct project and file IDs.  \n- **Example:** When a user requests a URD operation for a project:  \n  1. Retrieve the project list.  \n  2. Request confirmation from the user.  \n  3. Use the `project_id` to execute the operation. NEVER make assumptions about this ID.  \n- **Endpoints:**  \n  - /project - POST (create projects)  \n  - /delete_project - DELETE  \n  - /files - CREATE FILE  \n  - /update_file - UPDATE  \n  - /delete_file - DELETE  \n  - /projects - GET (Get projects)  \n  - /projects/{project_id} - PUT (Update projects), DELETE (projects)  \n  - /files/by_user/{ID} - GET (FILES BY USER ID)  \n  - /files/{file_id} - UPDATE (FILES), DELETE (files)  \n  - /files/by_project/{project_id} - GET (files by project_ID)  \n\n---\n\n**Help & Support:**  \n- **Description:** Obtain guidance on plugin usage and troubleshoot potential issues.  \n- **Endpoints:**  \n  - /get_status_messages  \n  - /help  \n\n---\n\nI hope this format meets your requirements.
