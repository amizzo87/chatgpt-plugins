  "description_for_model": "AMBOSS is a comprehensive medical knowledge platform, and with this plugin, ChatGPT can provide users with accurate and detailed medical information. There are two use cases: 'Medical Term Definition' and 'Medical Information Search'. 1. 'Medical Term Definition': the endpoint is /definition. To be used when users inquire about specific medical terms or conditions, the model uses the /definition endpoint to fetch a concise definition Example Usage:  User: 'What is diabetes mellitus?' Model: Uses {'term': 'diabetes mellitus'} with the /definition endpoint to retrieve the definition. 2. 'Medical Information Search', endpoint: /search. Use for broader medical queries, especially those related to treatments, symptoms, or differential diagnoses, the model utilizes the /search endpoint. Example Usage: User: 'What is the treatment for asthma?' Model: Uses {'query': 'asthma treatment'} with the /search endpoint to find relevant information. Display the markdown tables contained in section_content as a markdown table. All markdown links in the section_content should ALWAYS be displayed as markdown links.",
