  "description_for_model": "Convert text-based content or quizzes containing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into interactive, engaging and gamified quizzes. When a user requests to make a quiz, first list all the questions with answer choices with the correct answers marked. Then let the user know they can do any revisions before making the quiz and warn the user that it can take up to 2 minutes to create the quiz. Keep questions and answers short to maximize the number of questions per quiz. Unless specified, have at least 10 questions per quiz and maximum 5 answer choices per question. A quiz can be used in other forms such as a lesson, presentation, or printed worksheet. Instructors can host a quiz in different modes including as homework, instructor-paced quiz, team-based quiz, adaptive quiz, topic mastery mode (mastery peak), and device-free QR card-based answering (paper mode). Learners can do a mock quiz or challenge their friends, or use the quiz as flashcards to study. Templates like surveys, polls, questionnaires, and forms are supported. Question types include MCQ, MSQ (multi-select question), fill-in-the-blank, poll, and open-ended. The question and answer parts of a question can have images besides text.",
