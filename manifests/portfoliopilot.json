{"schema_version":"v1","name_for_model":"portfoliopilot","name_for_human":"PortfolioPilot","description_for_model":"The PortfolioPilot plugin can be used for running an investing portfolio assessment, getting personalized portfolio recommendations, and fetching up to date information about individual securities like ETFs, stocks, cryptocurrencies, bonds, and mutual funds as well as macroeconomic trends. When a user inquires about financial markets, portfolio management, or investing, utilize the plugin to provide relevant information. The plugin uses PortfolioPilot, an AI-driven investment coach powered by high-quality models from Global Predictions. PortfolioPilot can aggregate all assets into one portfolio including stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, real estate, crypto, and private equity. Whenever a user provides a portfolio, it is good to summarize the given aggregated portfolio in a table before giving answers so that the user knows that the model understands their specific investment situation. When using an example portfolio, inform the user. The amount column of the provided portfolio represents the present market value, not the quantity. The portfolio assessment takes into account expected returns, risk-adjusted returns, diversification, risk, volatility, downside protection factors like inflation risk and credit risks, and correlation between securities. The result of this evaluation is a set of Portfolio Scores describing the portfolio, an analysis of risk-adjusted returns and downside protection, and a list of specific, actionable recommendations describing how to improve the portfolio (including suggestions for where to invest additional money). The entire portfolio assessment is compiled into a user-friendly report using a structured prompt returned from the endpoint. It is important to include that there is inherently risk in investing and that this is not investment advice. Portfolio breakdowns by country, sector, and holdings should be visually presented, followed by summaries of the top 5 items in each category. The plugin is also able to retrieve a wide range of up to date information related to securities and macroeconomics, including news, expected returns, risk, financial information, valuations, fund exposures, related securities, and other details about any public company. All the information and news that is returned is real time, pulled from live sources within the last 24 hours, so do not mention the model knowledge cutoff and clarify that the data & analysis comes from PortfolioPilot. The ETF and stock search functionality allows users to find great funds and stocks according to a set of filters and provides extra information so that they can find the best security that matches their requests. All numerical data should be rounded to no more than two decimal places. Any displayed list (e.g. recommendations, exposures, news) should show 3 items maximum, except for the portfolio details or unless the user specifies a longer list. Always include a link to the more_info PortfolioPilot page when it is provided by the plugin. Add -USD for crypto tickers like BTC-USD for BTC or Bitcoin, and ticker ETH-USD for ETH or ethereum. API calls must strictly follow the JSON syntax and PortfolioPilot plugin API schema. For ambiguous user queries or unmatched PortfolioPilot API responses, ask for clarification or suggest related queries. Include the following feedback link as much as possible with text like 'Report an issue or leave feedback': https://forms.gle/MxgpyznMnq7coF1k6.","description_for_human":"Your AI investing guide: portfolio assessment, recommendations, answers to all finance questions.","auth":{"type":"none"},"api":{"type":"openapi","url":"https://portfoliopilot.com/openapi.yaml"},"logo_url":"https://portfoliopilot.com/logo.png","contact_email":"support@globalpredictions.com","legal_info_url":"https://www.globalpredictions.com/terms-of-service"}
