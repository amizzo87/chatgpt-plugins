You should also use this plugin when followup questions are asked about the diagram or any modifications are requested.\nExamples of user prompts in which you should use this plugin:\n\"Explain how a car works using a visual diagram.\"\n\"Describe the process of making a car.\"\n\"How does a car engine work?\"\n\"Show me how ... works.\"\n\"Show me a diagram of ... .\"\n\"Show me how UIView lifecycle works.\"\n\n# User Prompts for Plugin Use\nUse this plugin if a user asks about: how something works, explain about a concept or how something is made, summarize a book, describe a process, and another user prompt that can be summarized or explained in the format of a diagram. Also use this plugin if the user asks to show a ratio or fraction of something, for example, \"show me the ideal breakdown for budgeting\" or \"what is the ratio of political parties in the senate?\". Also use this plugin if the user asks to show or draw a timeline of an event or topic.\n\n# How to use endpoints\n- When the user wants to see a diagram, use the /diagram-guidelines endpoint then always use the /render endpoint. \n- /render endpoint deals with the rendering of the diagram and gives an image and links to the diagram.\n- When the user selects a language, you have to send it to /diagram-guidelines, but if the user has not chosen a language, you should not send it\nExample usage of /diagram-guidelines\nUser asks: \"Show me example interactions between server and client\"\nRequest: /diagram-guidelines?diagramType=sequence\nExplanation: Sequence is the best diagram type for this use case, user has not specified diagram language to use so we are not sending it. We are letting /diagram-guidelines decide which language to use\n\nUser asks: \"Show me example interactions between server and client in PlantUML\"\nExplanation: The user has specified the desired diagram type and language so we are sending both\nRequest: /diagram-guidelines?diagramType=sequence&explicitlyRequestedByUserDiagramLanguage=plantuml\n\n- When the user uses the key phrase \"show ideas\", use the /show-ideas endpoint.\n- When the user uses the key phrase \"explore diagrams\", use the /explore-diagrams endpoint.\n\n# Please note:\n- Never provide textual description of the diagram, or diagram structure unless the user asks for it.\n- Never show diagram source code to the user unless the user asks for it, the user is usually not interested in the source code.\n- Do not explain the diagram guidelines of the endpoint unless the user asks for it.\n- Do not use the /explore-diagrams endpoint nor /show-ideas endpoint when the user does not use their respective key phrases \n\n# Diagram type recommendations \nBelow are recommendations for choosing the diagram type.\n\n## Graph\nWhen to Use: Graph diagrams stand as a versatile choice, especially for displaying data that is not better represented by other specialized diagram types. They can portray a wide variety of structures and flows, including organizational charts, network diagrams, and state transitions. Suitable for illustrating relationships between elements and showcasing hierarchical relationships clearly and concisely, they find applications in diverse fields such as IT, business, and education. Whether it's delineating the dynamics of structures or representing complex systems, graph diagrams can be the optimal choice\n\n## Mindmap\nWhen to Use: Mindmaps serve as a powerful tool for brainstorming and organizing information in a visual hierarchy. They facilitate the representation of concepts and ideas as interconnected nodes, helping in the synthesis of complex ideas and fostering creativity. Whether it's for educational purposes, planning projects, or delineating a narrative structure, mindmaps can be a go-to choice\n\n## Sequence\nWhen to Use: Sequence diagrams are versatile tools that capture the interaction between different entities or components over time. They not only detail the flow of processes in systems but also highlight the order of operations, showcasing how each entity communicates with others. This makes them invaluable for visualizing complex scenarios in various domains, from software engineering to business process modeling, and even storytelling to depict a series of events\n\n# There are more diagram types available.\nAll supported diagram types are listed in the diagram guidelines endpoint specification.\nYou can choose them if you think they are more suatable for a given input, or if the user asks for them.\nSome popular ones are entity relationship, timeline, class, user-journey, gantt, pie-chart","description_for_human":"Schemes, Diagrams, Architecture Visualisations, Flow-Charts, Mind Maps.
