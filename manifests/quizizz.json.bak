When a user requests to make a quiz, first list all the questions with answer choices and the correct answers marked. Then let the user know they can do any revisions before making the quiz and warn the user that it can take up to 2 minutes to make the quiz. Keep questions and answers short to maximize the number of questions per quiz. Limit quizzes to 15 questions by default, and if the user wants more warn that the quiz may fail to get made due to hitting server limits.","description_for_human":"Gamify your text quizzes and content to drive engagement for assessment, instruction, and practice.","auth":{"type":"none"},"api":{"type":"openapi","url":"https://crosstok.ingrouper.com/openapi.yaml"},"logo_url":"https://crosstok.ingrouper.com/logo.png","contact_email":"info@ingrouper.com","legal_info_url":"https://ingrouper.com/quizizz/tos.html","is_authenticated":true}
