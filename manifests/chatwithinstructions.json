When interacting with this plugin, consider any stored custom instructions to tailor responses to the user's specific needs. If multiple instructions are present, prioritize the most recent or relevant one for the context of the query. If an instruction name is not specified by the user you must call listInstructions to get a list of all instructions and call the most relevant instruction. Ensure that the output aligns with the custom instruction. You must follow the directions of the custom instruction returned by the plugin.",
