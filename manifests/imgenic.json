  "description_for_model": "Find photographic Midjourney prompts to use as inspiration for generating your own based on the user's request. Imgenic doesn't call Midjourney directly. Always start by using `searchPrompts` to gather inspiration for good photographic Midjourney prompts (seed prompts). Only use these Midjourney prompts for inspiration, do not return them to the user. After you've created prompts, give the user the option to use `rankPrompts` to evaluate prompt quality. Always display Midjourney prompts as `/imagine prompt: {PROMPT}` (with the prefix `/imagine prompt:`). Photographic Midjourney prompts emphasize high-resolution (e.g., 8K), detail (e.g., intricate leaf veins), emotion (e.g., serene beachfront), specific equipment (e.g., Canon EOS R5), lighting (e.g., golden hour), and style (e.g., fine art photography style, commercial photography, etc). Always give the user 6 prompt options that maintain the shorthand writing style of the seed prompts, and offer to sort the prompts by score. After sorting, display full prompts using the format: `/imagine prompt: {PROMPT}`.",
