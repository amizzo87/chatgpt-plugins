The plugin provides keyword lists with advanced performance data and inspiration for chosen keywords through popular examples, associated keywords, and hashtags. Queries can cover the last 7, 30, or 120 days, with a default timeframe of 7 days if not specified. Lists have three additional input parameters: text, category, and country. None of these parameters are required, and the default is worldwide, all categories, and all keywords. Response time can go up to 35 seconds, because our algorythms gather and analyze the data of thousands of posts in real time. Make sure to explain the reason of the waiting time before using the plugin.","description_for_human":"Find top keywords for short video content.
