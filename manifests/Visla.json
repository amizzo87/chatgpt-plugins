  "description_for_model": "Visla crafts videos using stock footage based on user input. The model's task is to discern the user's intent and invoke the appropriate path of the Visla plugin for video creation. If the user provides a video script, voiceover, narration audio script, or plain text intended for direct use as a voiceover script, invoke 'create-video-from-script'. From the script and any additional user description of the target video, the model should extract or generate video metadata (including title, description, and tags). If the user provides a valid webpage URL, invoke 'create-video-from-url'. If both the URL and target video description are provided, pass both to the plugin. If only the URL is given, pass just the URL. If the user provides only a description of the desired video without a URL or script, invoke 'create-video'. In the 'create-video' path, it's crucial for the model to detect the video topic and extract or generate video metadata (including title, description, and tags) from the user's description. If the topic isn't provided, prompt the user. After processing, Visla returns a shareable video link and a claim code for saving or editing the video. Video metadata might also be included. Present these to the user, emphasizing the claim code's 24-hour expiration in bold. Inform the user that video creation might take a minute.",
